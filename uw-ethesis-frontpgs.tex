\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}
Options hedging is a critical problem in financial risk management. The prevailing approach in financial derivative pricing and hedging has been to firstly assume a parametric model describing the underlying price dynamics.  An option model function $V$ is then calibrated to current  market option prices and various sensitivities are computed and  used to hedge the option risk.  It has been recognized that computing hedging position from the sensitivity of the calibrated model option value function is inadequate in minimizing  the variance of the option hedging risk, as it fails to capture the model parameter dependence on the underlying price.
% In this thesis, we demonstrate that this issue can exist generally when determining hedging position from the sensitivity of the option function, either  calibrated from a parametric model from spot market option prices or estimated nonparametricaly from historical option prices. Consequently the sensitivity of the estimated model option function typically does not minimize variance of the hedge risk, even instantaneously, unless the parameters dependence is addressed. 
We propose several data-driven approaches to directly learn a hedging function from the historical market option and underlying data by minimizing certain measure of the local hedging risk and total hedging risk. This thesis will focus on answering the following questions: 1) Can we efficiently build direct data-driven models for discrete hedging problem that outperform existing state-of-art parametric hedging models based on the market prices? 2) Can we incorporate feature selection and feature extraction into the data-driven models to further improve the performance of the discrete hedging? 3) Can we build efficient models for both the one-step local risk hedging problem and multi-steps total risk hedging problem based on the state-of-art learning framework such as deep learning framework and kernel learning framework?

Using the S\&P 500 index daily option data for more than a decade ending in August 2015, we firstly propose a direct data-driven approach \citep{knian2017} based on kernel learning framework and we demonstrate  that the proposed method outperforms the parametric minimum variance hedging method proposed in \citep{hulloptimal}, as well as  minimum variance hedging corrective techniques based on stochastic volatility or local volatility models.
Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach achieves significant gain over the implied Black-Sholes delta hedging for weekly and monthly hedging.

Following the direct data-driven kernel learning approach \citep{knian2017}, we propose a robust encoder-decoder  Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, $\text{GRU}_{\delta}$, for optimal discrete option hedging. The proposed $\text{GRU}_{\delta}$ utilizes the Black-Scholes model as a pre-trained model and  incorporates sequential information and feature selection.  Using the S\&P 500 index European option market data from January 2, 2004 to August 31, 2015,   we demonstrate that the weekly and monthly hedging performance of the proposed $\text{GRU}_{\delta}$ significantly surpasses that of the data-driven minimum variance (MV) method in \citep{hulloptimal}, the regularized kernel data-driven model \citep{knian2017}, and the SABR-Bartlett method \cite{hagan2017bartlett}.
In addition, the daily hedging performance of the proposed $\text{GRU}_{\delta}$ also surpasses that of MV methods in \cite{hulloptimal} based on parametric models, the kernel method \citep{knian2017} and SABR-Bartlett method \cite{hagan2017bartlett}.

Lastly, we design a multi-steps data-driven models $\modelT$ based on the $\model$  to hedge the option discretely until the expiry.  We utilize SABR model and Local Volatility Function (LVF) to augment existing market data and thus alleviate the problem of  scarcity in market option prices. The augmented market data is used to train a sufficient  total risk hedging model $\modelT$.
